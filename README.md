CZ2006 Code_Monkey
==================

After starting the server:
* type localhost:9000/adddata1 to add test data: student, course
* type localhost:9000/adddata2 to add test data: registration, question, timeslot
* type localhost:9000 to enter the application

When a student is added, by now the system just set the password to be the matricNo but UPPERCASE.
Admin account and password are "admin".
